  abstract =  {{H}oney-bees are one of the most well studied social insects. {T}hey exhibit many features that distinguish their use as models for intelligent behavior. {T}hese features include division of labor, communication on the individual and group level, and cooperative behavior. {I}n this paper, we present a unified model for the marriage in honey-bees within an optimization context. {T}he model simulates the evolution of honey-bees starting with a solitary colony (single queen without a family) to the emergence of an eusocial colony (one or more queens with a family). {F}rom optimization point of view, the model is a committee machine approach where we evolve solutions using a committee of heuristics. {T}he model is applied to a fifty propositional satisfiability problems ({SAT}) with 50 variables and 215 constraints to guarantee that the problems are centered on the phase transition of 3-{SAT}. {O}ur aim in this paper is to analyze the behavior of the algorithm using biological concepts (number of queens, spermatheca size, and number of broods) rather than trying to improve the performance of the algorithm while losing the underlying biological essence. {N}otwithstanding, the algorithm outperformed {W}alk{SAT}, one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for {SAT}},

  abstract =       {{O}ver the past few years, the research on evolutionary algorithms has demonstrated their niche in solving multiobjective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a number of {P}areto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. {M}any studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the {P}areto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. {H}owever, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms ({MOEA}s) has a proof of convergence to the true {P}areto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. {I}n this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier {MOEA}s do not have such properties. {B}ased on the concept of {Î}µ-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to {MOEA}s that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. {A} number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested. {T}he concept of {Î}µ-dominance introduced in this paper is practical and should make the proposed algorithms useful to researchers and practitioners alike.},

  abstract =  {{A}rticle {B}ee {C}olony ({ABC}) is one of the most recently introduced algorithms based on the intelligent foraging behavior of a honey bee swarm. {T}his paper presents a variation on the original {ABC} algorithm, namely the {C}ooperative {A}rticle {B}ee {C}olony ({CABC}), which significantly improves the original {ABC} in solving complex optimization problems. {I}n this work, {CABC} algorithm is used for optimizing six widely-used benchmark functions and the comparative results produced by {ABC}, {P}article {S}warm {O}ptimization ({PSO}) and its cooperative version ({CPSO}) have been studied. {T}he simulation results showed that the proposed {CABC} outperforms the other three algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness and convergence speed.},
