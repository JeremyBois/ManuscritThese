  abstract  = {Honey-bees are one of the most well studied social insects. They exhibit many features that distinguish their use as models for intelligent behavior. These features include division of labor, communication on the individual and group level, and cooperative behavior. In this paper, we present a unified model for the marriage in honey-bees within an optimization context. The model simulates the evolution of honey-bees starting with a solitary colony (single queen without a family) to the emergence of an eusocial colony (one or more queens with a family). From optimization point of view, the model is a committee machine approach where we evolve solutions using a committee of heuristics. The model is applied to a fifty propositional satisfiability problems (SAT) with 50 variables and 215 constraints to guarantee that the problems are centered on the phase transition of 3-SAT. Our aim in this paper is to analyze the behavior of the algorithm using biological concepts (number of queens, spermatheca size, and number of broods) rather than trying to improve the performance of the algorithm while losing the underlying biological essence. Notwithstanding, the algorithm outperformed WalkSAT, one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for SAT},

This paper studies the active heating system of a passive house, which includes the following sub-systems: (1) solar thermal collectors, (2) a water storage tank, (3) a secondary water circuit, (4) a domestic hot water preparation system and (5) an air ventilation and heating system. Models for all sub-systems are presented. The integrated model was implemented to Pirmasens Passive House (Rhineland Palatinate, Germany). The active solar heating system provides a smaller amount of heat than the heat provided by the passive solar heating system. Almost all the solar energy collected is not used for space heating but to domestic hot water (DHW) preparation. However, there is still a need for the classical water heater to operate all over the year. Almost all space heating thermal load is covered by using the classical air heater that operates mainly during the nights from November to April. The solar fraction lies between 0.180 in February and 0.679 in October, with a yearly average of 0.446. The study reveals that on a yearly basis it is more advantageous to use vertical south-oriented solar collectors instead of roof placed collectors. },

Then, a mutation strategy based on opposition-based learning was proposed instead of the behavior of scouts. Application of this improved ABC algorithm on seven benchmark optimization functions shows a marked improvement in performance over the traditional ABC.},

In this chapter, we review F-Race, a racing algorithm for the task of automatic algorithm configuration. F-Race is based on a statistical approach for selecting the best configuration out of a set of candidate configurations under stochastic evaluations. We review the ideas underlying this technique and discuss an extension of the initial F-Race algorithm, which leads to a family of algorithms that we call iterated F-Race. Experimental results comparing one specific implementation of iterated F-Race to the original F-Race algorithm confirm the potential of this family of algorithms.},

  abstract     = {In 1991 Morris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. The method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. Despite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. In this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. In the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. The method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide (DMS), a gas involved in climate change. Results of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. },

The model is of interest because of the climatic relevance of the gas (dimethylsulphide, DMS), an initiator of cloud particles. A screening test at low sample size is applied first (Morris method) followed by a computationally intensive variance based measure. Standardised regression coefficients are also computed. The various SA measures are compared with each other, and the use of bootstrap is suggested to extract empirical confidence bounds on the SA estimators. For some of the input factors, investigators guess about the parameters relevance was confirmed; for some others, the results shed new light on the system mechanism and on the data parametrisation.},

A preliminary screening exercise is suggested in order to identify the subset of the most potentially explanatory factors. Afterwards, a quantitative method is recommended on the subset of preselected inputs. The advantage of the proposed procedure is that, very often, among a large number of input factors, only a few have a significant effect on the model output. The approach provides quantitative sensitivity measures while controlling the computational cost of the experiment. The procedure has been tested on a recent version of a chemical kinetics model of the tropospheric oxidation pathways of dimethylsulphide, including 68 uncertain factors.},

  abstract     = {The energy consumption of a building depends on the thermal demand and on the mean performance of the system. Apart from passive solar indoor climate control techniques, it is also possible to reduce conventional energy consumption of a building, even bringing it close to zero by installing solar heating. Hence, better knowledge of these techniques and of how they can be implemented in a simple but effective way will further progress towards more energy efficient buildings. The present work describes a straightforward procedure – applicable in any part of the world – to estimate the climate variables, to compare the efficiencies of solar heat collectors, and to size certain installations for domestic hot water, radiant flooring, or heating of buildings. The values of the climate variables – the monthly means of the daily values of solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and number of hours of sun – are determined from data available in the FAOś CLIMWAT\ database. Even though the calculation process uses approximate values for the variables involved rather than taking their dynamic evolution into account, it is fairly precise, giving results that are comparable to other more sophisticated and less easy to handle procedures such as the worldwide known f-CHART, TRNSYS, ISOFOTON\ and CENSOLAR\ computation programs. The predictive validity of the procedure has also been tested by comparing the results with those obtained experimentally via a solar heat collector installed on the roof of a building in the city of Badajoz. We believe that the procedure together with the computation program, will be of great use to builders and architects, since it allows a solar installation to be rapidly sized for applications in active solar heating schemes for building design. },

  abstract     = {Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) that use non-dominated sorting and sharing have been criticized mainly for: (1) their O(MN³) computational complexity (where M is the number of objectives and N is the population size); (2) their non-elitism approach; and (3) the need to specify a sharing parameter. In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN²) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed},

We study the ACS by running experiments to understand its operation. The results show that the ACS outperforms other nature-inspired algorithms such as simulated annealing and evolutionary computation, and we conclude comparing ACS-3-opt, a version of the ACS augmented with a local search procedure, to some of the best performing algorithms for symmetric and asymmetric TSPs},

The proposed mechanism is based on multiobjective optimization concepts taken from an approach called the Niched-Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA). The main advantages of the proposed approach is that it does not require the definition of any extra parameters, other than those required by an evolution strategy. The performance of the proposed approach is shown to be highly competitive with respect to other constraint-handling techniques representative of the state-of-the-art in the area when using a set of well-known benchmarks.},

Advanced automation and control for buildings and their components is one possibility how to achieve the desired goal of lower energy consumption. The model based predictive control approach as a special form of optimal control offers a good way to increase energy efficiency. This paper presents the employment of a model based predictive control algorithm for the energy efficient temperature control of a solar-thermal system consisting of a solar collector and a heat exchanger. The design of the controller is based upon a physical lumped model of the system components. In order to illustrate the potential of the model predictive approach for the use in building automation the comparison to a standard PI control approach is made where the energy consumption for both control concepts is analyzed.},

In this paper, we propose a new opposition-based learning fully informed particle swarm optimizer with favour ranking to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Instead of Pareto dominance, favour ranking is used to identify the best individuals in order to guide the search process in the proposed algorithm. Different from other multi-objective PSO, particles in swarm only have position without velocity and the personal best position gets updated using opposition-based learning and favour ranking. Besides, all personal best positions are considered to update particle position. Because of discarding the particle velocity and using full information and favour ranking, the algorithm is the simpler and more effective. The proposed algorithm is applied to some well-known benchmarks. Convergence metric, diversity metric are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. The experimental results show that the algorithm is effective on the benchmark functions.},

For each variant, the simulation outcomes to be discussed are the annual boiler efficiency, the cycling rate and, as the main indicator, the primary energy savings of the complete system. The results indicate that the effects of a solar thermal system on the annual boiler efficiency are small. Besides the system layout the annual amounts of hot water and space heating demand and their temperature levels affect the impact of the solar thermal system. Each additional storage tank, which is heated by conventional energy, should be analyzed critically due to their additional heat losses, which reduce the system efficiency. The latter is particularly true for a boiler buffer storage. This study points out that the savings of primary and final energy are the most important indicators for the assessment of solar thermal combi systems. Subsystem indicators like the annual values of collector yield and boiler efficiency give additional information, but they are not sufficient for a full evaluation of a complete system.},

Many of the systems analyzed are new installations in 2008, including two of the largest CPV\ systems in the world that together have 9.3 MW\ and represent more than 50\% of the worldś total CPV. The EP\ analysis shows: (1) compared with the fixed flat plate systems, 1-axis and 2-axis tracking flat plate systems have 22.3\% and 25.2\% gain in the annual EP, respectively. These real EP\ gains are less than 32.1\% for 1-axis and 38.7% for 2-axis tracking, which are the predicted gains when only considering the difference of captured illumination by these configurations (based on the data from Photovoltaic Geographical Information System (PVGIS)). (2) The EP\ from CPV\ systems is quite close to that from fixed flat plate systems. This differs from the predicted 16.1\% gain from CPV\ when only considering the illumination difference. Besides comparing the energy production, the performance ratio (PR) is also estimated and analyzed for the different configurations, based on the best available irradiation data. PR\ measures the agreement between the operation of a real system and of an ideal system that only considers the nominal module efficiency loss. The analysis shows the PR\ decreases in the order: fixed, 1-axis, 2-axis tracking flat plate, CPV.},

The performance of solar water heating systems is also compared with conventional systems that use either natural gas or electricity. The results showed that the flat-plate solar water heating systems using natural gas auxiliary heater has the best performance among all the types and at all locations. The energetic and environmental payback periods for solar water heating systems are less than half of a year, and the life cycle cost payback for solar water heating systems vary from 4 to 13 years for different cities and different configurations when using the conventional electrical water heating system in each city as the benchmark. For a representative case, i.e. flat-plate solar water heating system with natural gas auxiliary heater in Atlanta, sensitivity analysis shows that the daily hot water use has the most significant effects on energetic, environmental and economic performance. },

  abstract     = {The present study developed a maximum-power point tracking control (MPPT) technology for solar heating system to minimize the pumping power consumption at an optimal heat collection. The net solar energy gain Qnet (=Qs − Wp/ηe) was experimentally found to be the cost function for MPPT\ with maximum point. The feedback tracking control system was developed to track the optimal Qnet (denoted Qmax). A tracking filter which was derived from the thermal analytical model of the solar heating system was used to determine the instantaneous tracking target Qmax(t). The system transfer-function model of solar heating system was also derived experimentally using a step response test and used in the design of tracking feedback control system. The PI\ controller was designed for a tracking target Qmax(t) with a quadratic time function. The MPPT\ control system was implemented using a microprocessor-based controller and the test results show good tracking performance with small tracking errors. It is seen that the average mass flow rate for the specific test periods in five different days is between 18.1 and 22.9 kg/min with average pumping power between 77 and 140 W, which is greatly reduced as compared to the standard flow rate at 31 kg/min and pumping power 450 W which is based on the flow rate 0.02 kg/s m2 defined in the ANSI/ASHRAE 93-1986 Standard and the total collector area 25.9 m2. The average net solar heat collected Qnet is between 8.62 and 14.1 kW depending on weather condition. The MPPT\ control of solar heating system has been verified to be able to minimize the pumping energy consumption with optimal solar heat collection. },

Genetic algorithms, which are search procedures based on the mechanics of Darwinś natural selection, are employed since they have been proved to be robust and efficient in finding near-optimal solutions in complex problem spaces. The modular dynamic simulation software package HVACSIM\ + has been modified and incorporated in the genetic algorithm-based optimization program to provide a complete simulation environment for detailed study of controller performance. Three performance indicatorsâ€”overshoot, settling time, and mean squared errorâ€”are considered in the objective function of the optimization procedure for evaluation of controller performance. The simulation results show that the genetic algorithm-based optimization procedures as implemented in this research study are useful for automatic tuning of PID\ controllers for HVAC\ systems, yielding minimum overshoot and minimum settling time. },

It is recognized that the sole satisfaction of an annual balance is not sufficient to fully characterize Net ZEBs\ and the interaction between buildings and energy grids need to be addressed. It is also recognized that different definitions are possible, in accordance with a countryś political targets and specific conditions. This paper presents a consistent framework for setting Net ZEB\ definitions. Evaluation of the criteria in the definition framework and selection of the related options becomes a methodology to set Net ZEB\ definitions in a systematic way. The balance concept is central in the definition framework and two major types of balance are identified, namely the import/export balance and the load/generation balance. As compromise between the two a simplified monthly net balance is also described. Concerning the temporal energy match, two major characteristics are described to reflect a Net ZEBś ability to match its own load by on-site generation and to work beneficially with respect to the needs of the local grids. Possible indicators are presented and the concept of grid interaction flexibility is introduced as a desirable target in the building energy design.},

  abstract     = {In this paper the influence of domestic hot water (DHW) load profiles with a constant total yearly heat demand is studied for a solar combisystem. Whereas so far simulation studies are usually done with a simplified DHW\ load profile (e.g. according to prEN 12977), a more realistic profile was generated on a 1-min time scale with statistical means. Assumptions about the distribution of the DHW\ consumption during the year, depending also on the weekday, and the time of the day were made. To study the influence of the draw-off duration and flow rate as well as the daytime of DHW\ consumption, TRNSYS\ simulations were carried out with a variety of simplified and fairly realistic load profiles. In this case study the investigated solar system consists of a storage tank with an internal thermosyphonally driven discharge unit. Despite a rather minor influence of the draw-off flow rate on the fractional energy savings for the given system applying simplified profiles: a fairly wide range of more than 2 percentage points of the fractional energy savings was found for the system with some constructive improvements or for applying more realistic DHW-profiles. It can be concluded that the influence of the DHW-load profile may not be disregarded, when combistores are compared. This is true especially for stores, for which duration and flow rate of a DHW\ draw-off have a severe influence on the temperature stratification in the storage tank.},

  abstract     = {One possibility to exploit solar energy better is the efficiency enhancement of the control of solar thermal heating systems. In this paper an improved differential control and the generally used ordinary differential control operating with fixed switch-on and switch-off temperature differences are compared in different efficiency viewpoints. The comparison is based on measured data of a particular system at the Szent István University, Gödöllő and on a TRNSYS\ model developed for solar heating systems. According to the results the improved control provides a higher value of utilizability and brings forth fewer switch-ons and switch-offs for the pumps. These advantages nevertheless result in extended operation time and thus extended parasitic consumption of the pumps. This drawback can, however, be moderated or even extinguished by modern pumps with low energy consumption or if supplied by renewable energy source. Comparing the amount of utilized solar energy and consumed parasitic energy increments, the improved control can be generally recommended. },

  abstract       = {Over the past few years, the research on evolutionary algorithms has demonstrated their niche in solving multiobjective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a number of Pareto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. Many studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the Pareto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. However, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) has a proof of convergence to the true Pareto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. In this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier MOEAs do not have such properties. Based on the concept of Îµ-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to MOEAs that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. A number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested. The concept of Îµ-dominance introduced in this paper is practical and should make the proposed algorithms useful to researchers and practitioners alike.},

It is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. On the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. The goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. We describe different graph Laplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. Advantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

  abstract     = {The implementation of a variable structure fuzzy logic controller for a solar powered air conditioning system and its advantages are investigated in this paper. Two DC\ motors are used to drive the generator pump and the feed pump of the solar air-conditioner. Two different control schemes for the DC\ motors rotational speed adjustment are implemented and tested: the first one is a pure fuzzy controller, its output being the control signal for the DC\ motor driver. A 7 × 7 fuzzy matrix assigns the controller output with respect to the error value and the derivative of the error. The second scheme is a two-level controller. The lower level is a conventional PID\ controller, and the higher level is a fuzzy controller acting over the parameters of the low level controller. Step response of the two control loops are presented as experimental results. The contribution of this design is that in the control system, the fuzzy logic is implemented through software in a common, inexpensive, 16-bit microcontroller, which does not have special abilities for fuzzy control. },

Dans le second cas la sortie du PID est modifiée en fonction des conditions de fonctionnement permettant d’adapter la sortie à partir des informations connus.
On fit ainsi le P, I, D de manière séparée.
Il est ainsi possible d’augmenter le P durant la montée et ensuite fortement réduit une fois la cible atteinte pour éviter de dépasser.
Un PID le fait directement lorsqu’il est correctement dimensionné mais avec un compromis entre la phase de montée et stable.
Cette approche permet d’optimiser les deux phases dynamiquement.},

  abstract     = {The concept of Zero Energy Building (ZEB) has gained wide international attention during last few years and is now seen as the future target for the design of buildings. However, before being fully implemented in the national building codes and international standards, the ZEB\ concept requires clear and consistent definition and a commonly agreed energy calculation methodology. The most important issues that should be given special attention before developing a new ZEB\ definition are: (1) the metric of the balance, (2) the balancing period, (3) the type of energy use included in the balance, (4) the type of energy balance, (5) the accepted renewable energy supply options, (6) the connection to the energy infrastructure and (7) the requirements for the energy efficiency, the indoor climate and in case of gird connected ZEB\ for the building–grid interaction. This paper focuses on the review of the most of the existing ZEB\ definitions and the various approaches towards possible ZEB\ calculation methodologies. It presents and discusses possible answers to the abovementioned issues in order to facilitate the development of a consistent ZEB\ definition and a robust energy calculation methodology.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The purpose of this study is the technical and economic evaluation of a typical solar space and water heating system, utilized in an 88 m2 detached house that is designed according to the latest Greek Regulation on the Energy Performance of Buildings as a means toward Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). The analysis was conducted for each of the four climatic zones designated in the Greek Regulation. A financial analysis was performed and the Net Present Value and the Discounted Payback Period (DPBP) were calculated and correlated with the solar systems collector area and the storage tank volume. Furthermore, the annual avoided emissions from the substituted fossil fuels are estimated for the solar systems considered. The analysis demonstrates that the typical solar space and water heating system can provide a viable solution toward NZEB\ with solar coverage and DPBP\ being strongly influenced by the climatic zone of the building and the type of fossil fuel substituted. In all cases the solar system covers at least 45\% of the total heating loads while the payback period is as low as 4.5 years with an annual abatement of more than 50 t of CO2\ in the worst case scenario.},

In this paper a Population-based Ant Colony Optimization approach is proposed to solve multi-criteria optimization problems where the population of solutions is chosen from the set of all non-dominated solutions found so far. We investigate different maximum sizes for this population. The algorithm employs one pheromone matrix for each type of optimization criterion. The matrices are derived from the chosen population of solutions, and can cope with an arbitrary number of criteria. As a test problem, Single Machine Total Tardiness with changeover costs is used. 1},

  abstract     = {A novel swarm intelligence optimization technique is proposed called dragonfly algorithm (DA). The main inspiration of the DA algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of dragonflies in nature. Two essential phases of optimization, exploration and exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming dynamically or statistically. The paper also considers the proposal of binary and multi-objective versions of DA called binary DA (BDA) and multi-objective DA (MODA), respectively. The proposed algorithms are benchmarked by several mathematical test functions and one real case study qualitatively and quantitatively. The results of DA and BDA prove that the proposed algorithms are able to improve the initial random population for a given problem, converge towards the global optimum, and provide very competitive results compared to other well-known algorithms in the literature. The results of MODA also show that this algorithm tends to find very accurate approximations of Pareto optimal solutions with high uniform distribution for multi-objective problems. The set of designs obtained for the submarine propeller design problem demonstrate the merits of MODA in solving challenging real problems with unknown true Pareto optimal front as well. Note that the source codes of the DA, BDA, and MODA algorithms are publicly available at                   http://www.alimirjalili.com/DA.html                                  .},

The simplified procedure was applied to the case of an individual dwelling using a solar collector field to produce domestic hot water and space heating. The building and the solar installation have then been modelled with the software TRNSYS\ 16 and their behaviour was simulated during a whole year.

This chapter presents a novel scheme to make the differential evolution (DE) algorithm faster. The proposed opposition-based DE (ODE) employs opposition-based optimization (OBO) for population initialization and also for generation jumping. In this work, opposite numbers have been utilized to improve the convergence rate of the classical DE. A test suite with 15 benchmark functions is employed for experimental verification. The contribution of the opposite numbers is empirically verified. Additionally, two time varying models for control parameter adjustment of ODE are investigated. Details of the ODE algorithm, the test set, and the comparison strategy are provided.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, a revised version of the Morris approach, which includes an improved sampling strategy based on trajectory design, has been adapted to the screening of the most influential parameters of a fuzzy controller applied to WWTPs. Due to the high number of parameters, a systematic approach has been proposed to apply this improved sampling strategy with low computational demand. In order to find out the proper repetition number of elementary effects of each input factor on model output (EEi) calculations, an iterative and automatic procedure has been applied. The results show that the sampling strategy has a significant effect on the parameter significance ranking and that random sampling could lead to a non-proper coverage of the parameter space. },

  abstract  = {Spectral clustering methods are common graph-based approaches to clustering of data. Spectral clustering algorithms typically start from local information encoded in a weighted graph on the data and cluster according to the global eigenvectors of the corresponding (normalized) similarity matrix. One contribution of this paper is to present fundamental limitations of this general local to global approach. We show that based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. Further, even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the first few eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and density. Based on these findings, a second contribution of this paper is a novel diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters. Our measure can be used in conjunction with any bottom-up graph-based clustering method, it is scale-free and can determine coherent clusters at all scales. We present both synthetic examples and real image segmentation problems where various spectral clustering algorithms fail. In contrast, using this coherence measure finds the expected clusters at all scales.},

  abstract     = {Solar collectors need to be tilted at the correct angle to maximize the performance of the system. In this paper, the annual solar fraction of the system (the fraction of energy that is supplied by solar energy) is used as an indicator to find the optimum inclination angles for a thermosyphon solar water heater installed in northern and southern parts of Jordan. Calculations are carried out using the powerful computer program TRNSYS\ (Transient System Simulation). The system is assumed to operate with a daily hot water load of 150 l at 55°C flowing during the day according to the widely used Rand consumption profile. The results show that the optimum inclination angle for the maximum solar fraction is about φ+(0→10°) for the northern region (represented by Amman) and about φ+(0→20°) for the southern region (represented by the town of Aqaba). These values are greater than those for maximum solar radiation (which is commonly used as an indicator) at the top of the collector by about 5 to 8°.},

As an example, a two zone fan-coil heating (FCH) system is considered. The thermal dynamics of the FCH\ system and environmental zones are simulated by a nonlinear model. The environmental zones are acted upon by multiple disturbances, such as changes in outdoor temperature, solar radiation fluxes and dynamic disturbances due to the thermal inertia of the enclosure elements. The control objective is to hold the zone temperatures and the boiler temperature close to their respective setpoints irrespective of the changes in disturbances acting on the system. A multivariable adaptive controller based on LQR\ (Linear Quadratic Regulator) theory is designed. Simulation results showing the closed loop response of the system to changes in operating points, external disturbances, changes in system parameters and unmodeled dynamics are presented. It is shown that the adaptive controller is able to adapt to a wide range of operating conditions and is able to maintain the zone temperatures and the boiler temperature close to their respective setpoints.},

This paper investigates solar potential regarding photovoltaic and solar thermal utilization in typical residential buildings in order to identify their impact towards nearly Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEB). Different options regarding the installed capacity of photovoltaics and solar combi systems in various locations and climatic conditions are evaluated from a technical as well as from an economic point of view. The results indicate that in all cases, photovoltaics are able to cover the annual electricity demand of a residential building with a payback period of less than 7 years. In the case of solar combi systems, payback period ranges between 5.5 and 6.5 years when compared with a conventional fuel oil heating boiler and 9 years when compared with a natural gas boiler, providing at least 50\% of the total heating demand of the buildings. In total, solar energy systems are able to cover at least 76\% of the primary energy demand of residential buildings proving that they are a viable solution towards NZEB.},

  abstract       = {To understand the foraging strategy of honeybee colonies, we measured certain temporal and spatial patterns in the foraging activities of a colony living in a temperate deciduous forest. We monitored foraging activities by housing the colony in an observation hive and reading its recruitment dances to map its food source patches. We found that the colony routinely foraged several kilometres from its nest (median 1.7 km, 95\% of foraging within 6.0 km), frequently (at least daily) adjusted its distribution of foragers on its patches, and worked relatively few patches each day (mean of 9.7 patches accounted for 90\% of each days forage). These foraging patterns, together with prior studies on the mechanisms of honeybee recruitment communication, indicate that the foraging strategy of a honeybee colony involves surveying the food source patches within a vast area around its nest, pooling the reconnaissance of its many foragers, and using this information to focus its forager force on a few high-quality patches within its foraging area.},

The library supports rapid prototyping, as well as design and operation of building energy and control systems. First, we describe the scope of the library, which covers heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, multi-zone heat transfer and multi-zone airflow and contaminant transport. Next, we describe differentiability requirements and address how we implemented them. We describe the class hierarchy that allows implementing component models by extending partial implementations of base models of heat and mass exchangers, and by instantiating basic models for conservation equations and flow resistances. We also describe associated tools for pre- and post-processing, regression tests, co-simulation and real-time data exchange with building automation systems. The article closes with an example of a chilled water plant, with and without water-side economizer, in which we analysed the system-level efficiency for different control setpoints. },

These two values are used to modify the objective space. The modified objective functions are used in the non- dominance sorting so that the algorithm evolves feasible optimal solutions not only from the feasible space but also from the infeasible space. The search in the infeasible space is designed to encourage those individuals with better objective value and low constraint violation. The number of feasible individuals in the population is used to guide the search process either toward finding more feasible solutions or toward finding optimum solutions. The proposed method is simple to implement and does not need any parameter tuning. The constraint handling technique was tested on several constrained multi-objective problems and has shown superior results.},

Results are presented for the pay-off characteristics between energy cost and zone thermal comfort, for three design days and three building weights. Inspection of the solutions indicates that the MOGA\ is able to find the optimum pay-off characteristic between the daily energy cost and zone thermal comfort. It can be concluded that multi-criterion genetic algorithm search methods offer great potential for the identification of the pay-off between the elements of building thermal design, and as such can help inform the building design process. },

A novel approach called “multi-hive artificial bee colony” for constrained multi-objective optimization (MHABC-CMO) is proposed based on this model. A novel information transfer strategy among multiple swarms and division operator are proposed in MHABC-CMO to tie it closer to natural evolution, as well as improve the robustness of the algorithm. Simulation experiment of MHABC-CMO on a set of benchmark test functions are compared with other nature inspired techniques which includes multi-objective artificial bee colony (MOABC), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO). The numerical results demonstrate MHABC-CMO approach is a powerful search and optimization technique for constrained multi-objective optimization.},

By evolving a population of solutions, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are able to approximate the Pareto optimal set in a single run. MOEAs\ have attracted a lot of research effort during the last 20 years, and they are still one of the hottest research areas in the field of evolutionary computation. This paper surveys the development of MOEAs\ primarily during the last eight years. It covers algorithmic frameworks such as decomposition-based MOEAs\ (MOEA/Ds), memetic MOEAs, coevolutionary MOEAs, selection and offspring reproduction operators, MOEAs\ with specific search methods, MOEAs\ for multimodal problems, constraint handling and MOEAs, computationally expensive multiobjective optimization problems (MOPs), dynamic MOPs, noisy MOPs, combinatorial and discrete MOPs, benchmark problems, performance indicators, and applications. In addition, some future research issues are also presented.},

In this work, CABC algorithm is used for optimizing six widely-used benchmark functions and the comparative results produced by ABC, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and its cooperative version (CPSO) have been studied. The simulation results showed that the proposed CABC outperforms the other three algorithms in terms of accuracy, robustness and convergence speed.},

The paper reviews current trends in simulation-based building performance optimization (BPO) and outlines major criteria for optimization tools selection and evaluation. This is based on analyzing userś needs for tools capabilities and requirement specifications. The review is carried out by means of a literature review of 165 publications and interviews with 28 optimization experts. The findings are based on an inter-group comparison between experts. The aim is to assess the gaps and needs for integrating BPO\ tools in NZEB\ design. The findings indicate a breakthrough in using evolutionary algorithms in solving highly constrained envelope, HVAC\ and renewable optimization problems. Simple genetic algorithm solved many design and operation problems and allowed measuring the improvement in the optimality of a solution against a base case. Evolutionary algorithms are also easily adapted to enable them to solve a particular optimization problem more effectively. However, existing limitations including model uncertainty, computation time, difficulty of use and steep learning curve. Some future directions anticipated or needed for improvement of current tools are presented.},

  abstract    = {Étant de plus en plus isolés, les bâtiments très performants sont très sensibles aux apports solaires transmis par les vitrages ainsi qu'aux apports internes. Dans ce contexte, l'inertie thermique peut être utile en stockant l'énergie excédentaire et en réduisant les variations de température, améliorant ainsi le confort thermique.Évaluer la performance énergétique, environnementale et le confort thermique des bâtiments nécessite des outils de simulation thermique dynamique (STD) fiables. Historiquement, les modélisateurs ont essayé de trouver un compromis approprié entre précision et efficacité. Des hypothèses simplificatrices ont alors été intégrées dans les outils STD et ont un lien étroit avec l'inertie thermique. La validité de telles hypothèses, notamment la globalisation des échanges convectifs et radiatifs GLO intérieurs, ou la distribution forfaitaire des apports solaires transmis par les vitrages nécessitent particulièrement d'être remises en questions dans le contexte des bâtiments très isolés.Ainsi, un modèle découplant les échanges convectifs et radiatifs GLO ainsi qu'un modèle de suivi de la tache solaire (modèles détaillés) ont été implémentés dans une plateforme de simulation mettant en œuvre l'analyse modale et une discrétisation par volumes finis.Une première comparaison entre les modèles détaillés et simplifiés a été réalisée sur des cas d'études du "BESTEST", intégrant aussi des résultats d'outils STD de référence au niveau international (EnergyPlus, ESP-r, TRNSYS). Un travail similaire a été réalisé sur le cas d'une maison passive instrumentée (plateforme INCAS à Chambéry) en utilisant des techniques d'analyses d'incertitudes et de sensibilité.Les résultats montrent qu'une tendance à la baisse concernant les besoins de chauffage et de refroidissement existe en ce qui concerne les modèles détaillés considérés ici. D'autre part, il semble que ces modèles détaillés ne contribuent pas à diminuer significativement les écarts entre les simulations et les mesures},

We also discuss the main physical assumptions. The room model can be parameterized to use di↵erent modeling assump-tions, leading to linear or non-linear di↵erential algebraic systems of equations. We present nu-merical experiments that show how these assump-tions a↵ect computing time and accuracy for se-lected cases of the ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140-2007 envelop validation tests.},

  abstract     = {Net-zero energy buildings (NZEBs) are expected to play an important role in fighting climate change and reducing the energy use of the built environment. But even if the best design practices are widely adopted and implemented, this will only mitigate global warming. It is too late to prevent it. Yet buildings – including net-zero energy buildings – are often designed using historical data representing the average climate between 1961 and 1990, or between 1976 and 2005 at best. This paper investigates the use of the downscaling method known as “morphing”, proposed by Belcher et al. (2005), to generate weather data files. The impact of using these weather files on the energy performance of an actual NZEB is then assessed. Morphing is applied to typical “horizon years” representative of future climate and also on a month-by-month and year-by-year basis using raw data from a selected GCM. A 50-year series of hourly weather data is obtained and analyzed for two different locations, Montréal (QC) and Massena (NY). The data are then used to simulate the performance of a net-zero energy home as it was designed using historical data. The results show that the building misses the net-zero energy target for most years. The year-to-year variability of the total energy use is relatively small but the impact on the energy excess or shortage in relation to the net-zero target is significant. climate-sensitive buildings such as NZEBs should always be designed using multi-year simulations with weather data that take climate change into account.},

  abstract     = { We develop a method, here called ‘morphing’, to produce design weather data for building thermal simulations that accounts for future changes to climate. Morphing combines present-day observed weather data with results from climate models. The procedure yields weather time series that encapsulate the average weather conditions of future climate scenarios, whilst preserving realistic weather sequences. In this sense the method ‘downscales’ coarse resolution climate model predictions to the fine spatial and temporal resolutions required for building thermal simulations. The morphing procedure is illustrated by application to CIBSE design weather years and climate change scenarios for the UK. Heating degree days calculated from the weather series morphed to future climates show a marked reduction compared to present day, by an amount that agrees well with results calculated directly from the climate model. This agreement gives confidence that the morphing technique faithfully transforms the weather sequences.Practical application: There is overwhelming consensus amongst the scientific community that the Earth's climate is warming. This warming will have implications for building services in the UK that should be considered now. This article describes a method for producing weather data with best current estimates of future climate that can be used to quantify the risk of building overheating. },
