  abstract  = {{H}oney-bees are one of the most well studied social insects. {T}hey exhibit many features that distinguish their use as models for intelligent behavior. {T}hese features include division of labor, communication on the individual and group level, and cooperative behavior. {I}n this paper, we present a unified model for the marriage in honey-bees within an optimization context. {T}he model simulates the evolution of honey-bees starting with a solitary colony (single queen without a family) to the emergence of an eusocial colony (one or more queens with a family). {F}rom optimization point of view, the model is a committee machine approach where we evolve solutions using a committee of heuristics. {T}he model is applied to a fifty propositional satisfiability problems ({SAT}) with 50 variables and 215 constraints to guarantee that the problems are centered on the phase transition of 3-{SAT}. {O}ur aim in this paper is to analyze the behavior of the algorithm using biological concepts (number of queens, spermatheca size, and number of broods) rather than trying to improve the performance of the algorithm while losing the underlying biological essence. {N}otwithstanding, the algorithm outperformed {W}alk{SAT}, one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for {SAT}},

  abstract   = {{I}n 1991 {M}orris proposed an effective screening sensitivity measure to identify the few important factors in models with many factors. {T}he method is based on computing for each input a number of incremental ratios, namely elementary effects, which are then averaged to assess the overall importance of the input. {D}espite its value, the method is still rarely used and instead local analyses varying one factor at a time around a baseline point are usually employed. {I}n this piece of work we propose a revised version of the elementary effects method, improved in terms of both the definition of the measure and the sampling strategy. {I}n the present form the method shares many of the positive qualities of the variance-based techniques, having the advantage of a lower computational cost, as demonstrated by the analytical examples. {T}he method is employed to assess the sensitivity of a chemical reaction model for dimethylsulphide ({DMS}), a gas involved in climate change. {R}esults of the sensitivity analysis open up the ground for model reconsideration: some model components may need a more thorough modelling effort while some others may need to be simplified. },

  abstract   = {{T}he energy consumption of a building depends on the thermal demand and on the mean performance of the system. {A}part from passive solar indoor climate control techniques, it is also possible to reduce conventional energy consumption of a building, even bringing it close to zero by installing solar heating. {H}ence, better knowledge of these techniques and of how they can be implemented in a simple but effective way will further progress towards more energy efficient buildings. {T}he present work describes a straightforward procedure – applicable in any part of the world – to estimate the climate variables, to compare the efficiencies of solar heat collectors, and to size certain installations for domestic hot water, radiant flooring, or heating of buildings. {T}he values of the climate variables – the monthly means of the daily values of solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and number of hours of sun – are determined from data available in the {FAO}'s \{CLIMWAT\} database. {E}ven though the calculation process uses approximate values for the variables involved rather than taking their dynamic evolution into account, it is fairly precise, giving results that are comparable to other more sophisticated and less easy to handle procedures such as the worldwide known f-{CHART}, {TRNSYS}, \{ISOFOTON\} and \{CENSOLAR\} computation programs. {T}he predictive validity of the procedure has also been tested by comparing the results with those obtained experimentally via a solar heat collector installed on the roof of a building in the city of {B}adajoz. {W}e believe that the procedure together with the computation program, will be of great use to builders and architects, since it allows a solar installation to be rapidly sized for applications in active solar heating schemes for building design. },

  review     = {Approches simplifiées sur-estime fortement la performances de capteurs sous-vide résultant en un résultat biaisé lors d’étude de cas.
C’est aussi vrai pour les capteurs plans mais dans une moindre mesure.
La méthode développée et la methode Censolar semblent cependant mieux s’en sortir.
L’utilisation d’un outil de simulation dynamique permet de tenir compte de la forte variation pour des besoins faibles.

Le papier montre aussi que les approches simplifiées sur-estime particulièrement la performance des systèmes pour des besoins inférieur à 2500 l / jour ce qui est toujours le cas en maison individuelle.

Les surfaces de capteur ne sont pas les mêmes entre les differentes simulations
Le capteur sous-vide à un rendement optique très important.

La méthode donne de bon résultat mais n’est pas adaptée pour des applications en maisons individuelles où les besoins sont faible (<2500 l/jour).
De plus cette approche ne permet pas de tenir compte de la dynamique du système et de son mode de fonctionnement.

Comme l’auteur le souligne en conclusion sont outil est plus adapté aux professionnels et non pour faire de la recherche sur l’optimisation de systèmes solaires},

  abstract =  {{S}ome particle swarm optimization({PSO}) algorithms have been proposed in recent past to tackle the multi-objective optimization problems based on the concept of {P}areto optimality. {I}n this paper, we propose a new opposition-based learning fully informed particle swarm optimizer with favour ranking to solve multi-objective optimization problems. {I}nstead of {P}areto dominance, favour ranking is used to identify the best individuals in order to guide the search process in the proposed algorithm. {D}ifferent from other multi-objective {PSO}, particles in swarm only have position without velocity and the personal best position gets updated using opposition-based learning and favour ranking. {B}esides, all personal best positions are considered to update particle position. {B}ecause of discarding the particle velocity and using full information and favour ranking, the algorithm is the simpler and more effective. {T}he proposed algorithm is applied to some well-known benchmarks. {C}onvergence metric, diversity metric are used to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. {T}he experimental results show that the algorithm is effective on the benchmark functions.},

  abstract   = {{I}n this paper the influence of domestic hot water ({DHW}) load profiles with a constant total yearly heat demand is studied for a solar combisystem. {W}hereas so far simulation studies are usually done with a simplified \{DHW\} load profile (e.g. according to pr{EN} 12977), a more realistic profile was generated on a 1-min time scale with statistical means. {A}ssumptions about the distribution of the \{DHW\} consumption during the year, depending also on the weekday, and the time of the day were made. {T}o study the influence of the draw-off duration and flow rate as well as the daytime of \{DHW\} consumption, \{TRNSYS\} simulations were carried out with a variety of simplified and fairly realistic load profiles. {I}n this case study the investigated solar system consists of a storage tank with an internal thermosyphonally driven discharge unit. {D}espite a rather minor influence of the draw-off flow rate on the fractional energy savings for the given system applying simplified profiles: a fairly wide range of more than 2 percentage points of the fractional energy savings was found for the system with some constructive improvements or for applying more realistic {DHW}-profiles. {I}t can be concluded that the influence of the {DHW}-load profile may not be disregarded, when combistores are compared. {T}his is true especially for stores, for which duration and flow rate of a \{DHW\} draw-off have a severe influence on the temperature stratification in the storage tank. },

Les variations sont de l’ordre de 3 % ce qui n’est pas negligeable.

La variation du débit de puisage ne semble pas impacter la performance du système.

Enfin il semble qu’un profil de puisage en fin de journée soit plus favorable et que peu de différences soient notables entre un puisage le matin et le midi.},

  abstract       = {{O}ver the past few years, the research on evolutionary algorithms has demonstrated their niche in solving multiobjective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a number of {P}areto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. {M}any studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the {P}areto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. {H}owever, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms ({MOEA}s) has a proof of convergence to the true {P}areto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. {I}n this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier {MOEA}s do not have such properties. {B}ased on the concept of {Î}µ-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to {MOEA}s that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. {A} number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested. {T}he concept of {Î}µ-dominance introduced in this paper is practical and should make the proposed algorithms useful to researchers and practitioners alike.},

Dans le second cas la sortie du PID est modifiée en fonction des conditions de fonctionnement permettant d’adapter la sortie à partir des informations connus.
On fit ainsi le P, I, D de manière séparée. 
Il est ainsi possible d’augmenter le P durant la montée et ensuite fortement réduit une fois la cible atteinte pour éviter de dépasser.
Un PID le fait directement lorsqu’il est correctement dimensionné mais avec un compromis entre la phase de montée et stable.

  abstract   = {{A} novel swarm intelligence optimization technique is proposed called dragonfly algorithm ({DA}). {T}he main inspiration of the {DA} algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of dragonflies in nature. {T}wo essential phases of optimization, exploration and exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming dynamically or statistically. {T}he paper also considers the proposal of binary and multi-objective versions of {DA} called binary {DA} ({BDA}) and multi-objective {DA} ({MODA}), respectively. {T}he proposed algorithms are benchmarked by several mathematical test functions and one real case study qualitatively and quantitatively. {T}he results of {DA} and {BDA} prove that the proposed algorithms are able to improve the initial random population for a given problem, converge towards the global optimum, and provide very competitive results compared to other well-known algorithms in the literature. {T}he results of {MODA} also show that this algorithm tends to find very accurate approximations of {P}areto optimal solutions with high uniform distribution for multi-objective problems. {T}he set of designs obtained for the submarine propeller design problem demonstrate the merits of {MODA} in solving challenging real problems with unknown true {P}areto optimal front as well. {N}ote that the source codes of the {DA}, {BDA}, and {MODA} algorithms are publicly available at                   http://www.alimirjalili.com/{DA}.html                                  .},

  abstract   = {{I}n this paper, a revised version of the {M}orris approach, which includes an improved sampling strategy based on trajectory design, has been adapted to the screening of the most influential parameters of a fuzzy controller applied to {WWTP}s. {D}ue to the high number of parameters, a systematic approach has been proposed to apply this improved sampling strategy with low computational demand. {I}n order to find out the proper repetition number of elementary effects of each input factor on model output ({EE}i) calculations, an iterative and automatic procedure has been applied. {T}he results show that the sampling strategy has a significant effect on the parameter significance ranking and that random sampling could lead to a non-proper coverage of the parameter space. },

  abstract  = {{S}pectral clustering methods are common graph-based approaches to clustering of data. {S}pectral clustering algorithms typically start from local information encoded in a weighted graph on the data and cluster according to the global eigenvectors of the corresponding (normalized) similarity matrix. {O}ne contribution of this paper is to present fundamental limitations of this general local to global approach. {W}e show that based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. {F}urther, even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the first few eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and density. {B}ased on these findings, a second contribution of this paper is a novel diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters. {O}ur measure can be used in conjunction with any bottom-up graph-based clustering method, it is scale-free and can determine coherent clusters at all scales. {W}e present both synthetic examples and real image segmentation problems where various spectral clustering algorithms fail. {I}n contrast, using this coherence measure finds the expected clusters at all scales.},
