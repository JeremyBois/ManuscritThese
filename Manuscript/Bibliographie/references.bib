  abstract =  {{H}oney-bees are one of the most well studied social insects. {T}hey exhibit many features that distinguish their use as models for intelligent behavior. {T}hese features include division of labor, communication on the individual and group level, and cooperative behavior. {I}n this paper, we present a unified model for the marriage in honey-bees within an optimization context. {T}he model simulates the evolution of honey-bees starting with a solitary colony (single queen without a family) to the emergence of an eusocial colony (one or more queens with a family). {F}rom optimization point of view, the model is a committee machine approach where we evolve solutions using a committee of heuristics. {T}he model is applied to a fifty propositional satisfiability problems ({SAT}) with 50 variables and 215 constraints to guarantee that the problems are centered on the phase transition of 3-{SAT}. {O}ur aim in this paper is to analyze the behavior of the algorithm using biological concepts (number of queens, spermatheca size, and number of broods) rather than trying to improve the performance of the algorithm while losing the underlying biological essence. {N}otwithstanding, the algorithm outperformed {W}alk{SAT}, one of the state-of-the-art algorithms for {SAT}},

  abstract =   {{T}he energy consumption of a building depends on the thermal demand and on the mean performance of the system. {A}part from passive solar indoor climate control techniques, it is also possible to reduce conventional energy consumption of a building, even bringing it close to zero by installing solar heating. {H}ence, better knowledge of these techniques and of how they can be implemented in a simple but effective way will further progress towards more energy efficient buildings. {T}he present work describes a straightforward procedure – applicable in any part of the world – to estimate the climate variables, to compare the efficiencies of solar heat collectors, and to size certain installations for domestic hot water, radiant flooring, or heating of buildings. {T}he values of the climate variables – the monthly means of the daily values of solar radiation, maximum and minimum temperatures, and number of hours of sun – are determined from data available in the {FAO}'s \{CLIMWAT\} database. {E}ven though the calculation process uses approximate values for the variables involved rather than taking their dynamic evolution into account, it is fairly precise, giving results that are comparable to other more sophisticated and less easy to handle procedures such as the worldwide known f-{CHART}, {TRNSYS}, \{ISOFOTON\} and \{CENSOLAR\} computation programs. {T}he predictive validity of the procedure has also been tested by comparing the results with those obtained experimentally via a solar heat collector installed on the roof of a building in the city of {B}adajoz. {W}e believe that the procedure together with the computation program, will be of great use to builders and architects, since it allows a solar installation to be rapidly sized for applications in active solar heating schemes for building design. },

L’utilisation d’un outil de simulation dynamique permet de tenir compte de la forte variation pour des besoins faibles.

Le capteur sous-vide à un rendement optique très important.

La méthode donne de bon résultat mais n’est pas adaptée pour des applications en maisons individuelles où les besoins sont faible (<2500 l/jour).

(2) {T}he \{EP\} from \{CPV\} systems is quite close to that from fixed flat plate systems. {T}his differs from the predicted 16.1% gain from \{CPV\} when only considering the illumination difference. {B}esides comparing the energy production, the performance ratio ({PR}) is also estimated and analyzed for the different configurations, based on the best available irradiation data. \{PR\} measures the agreement between the operation of a real system and of an ideal system that only considers the nominal module efficiency loss. {T}he analysis shows the \{PR\} decreases in the order: fixed, 1-axis, 2-axis tracking flat plate, {CPV}. },

  abstract =   {{O}ne possibility to exploit solar energy better is the efficiency enhancement of the control of solar thermal heating systems. {I}n this paper an improved differential control and the generally used ordinary differential control operating with fixed switch-on and switch-off temperature differences are compared in different efficiency viewpoints. {T}he comparison is based on measured data of a particular system at the {S}zent {I}stván {U}niversity, {G}ödöllő and on a \{TRNSYS\} model developed for solar heating systems. {A}ccording to the results the improved control provides a higher value of utilizability and brings forth fewer switch-ons and switch-offs for the pumps. {T}hese advantages nevertheless result in extended operation time and thus extended parasitic consumption of the pumps. {T}his drawback can, however, be moderated or even extinguished by modern pumps with low energy consumption or if supplied by renewable energy source. {C}omparing the amount of utilized solar energy and consumed parasitic energy increments, the improved control can be generally recommended. },

Pour ça il cherche à tenir compte des pertes et de la performance de l’échangeur pour déterminer un delta T optimal qui sera utilisé pour définir les règles d’activation.

Il montre que son approche permet d’améliorer les performances mais surtout la durée de vie des pompes en limitant les arrêts intempestifs.

  abstract =       {{O}ver the past few years, the research on evolutionary algorithms has demonstrated their niche in solving multiobjective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a number of {P}areto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. {M}any studies have depicted different ways evolutionary algorithms can progress towards the {P}areto-optimal set with a widely spread distribution of solutions. {H}owever, none of the multiobjective evolutionary algorithms ({MOEA}s) has a proof of convergence to the true {P}areto-optimal solutions with a wide diversity among the solutions. {I}n this paper, we discuss why a number of earlier {MOEA}s do not have such properties. {B}ased on the concept of {Î}µ-dominance, new archiving strategies are proposed that overcome this fundamental problem and provably lead to {MOEA}s that have both the desired convergence and distribution properties. {A} number of modifications to the baseline algorithm are also suggested. {T}he concept of {Î}µ-dominance introduced in this paper is practical and should make the proposed algorithms useful to researchers and practitioners alike.},

  abstract =  {{I}n recent years, spectral clustering has become one of the most popular modern clustering algorithms. {I}t is simple to implement, can be solved efficiently by standard linear algebra software, and very often outperforms traditional clustering algorithms such as the k-means algorithm. {O}n the first glance spectral clustering appears slightly mysterious, and it is not obvious to see why it works at all and what it really does. {T}he goal of this tutorial is to give some intuition on those questions. {W}e describe different graph {L}aplacians and their basic properties, present the most common spectral clustering algorithms, and derive those algorithms from scratch by several different approaches. {A}dvantages and disadvantages of the different spectral clustering algorithms are discussed.},

  abstract =   {{T}he implementation of a variable structure fuzzy logic controller for a solar powered air conditioning system and its advantages are investigated in this paper. {T}wo \{DC\} motors are used to drive the generator pump and the feed pump of the solar air-conditioner. {T}wo different control schemes for the \{DC\} motors rotational speed adjustment are implemented and tested: the first one is a pure fuzzy controller, its output being the control signal for the \{DC\} motor driver. {A} 7 × 7 fuzzy matrix assigns the controller output with respect to the error value and the derivative of the error. {T}he second scheme is a two-level controller. {T}he lower level is a conventional \{PID\} controller, and the higher level is a fuzzy controller acting over the parameters of the low level controller. {S}tep response of the two control loops are presented as experimental results. {T}he contribution of this design is that in the control system, the fuzzy logic is implemented through software in a common, inexpensive, 16-bit microcontroller, which does not have special abilities for fuzzy control. },

  abstract =   {{A} novel swarm intelligence optimization technique is proposed called dragonfly algorithm ({DA}). {T}he main inspiration of the {DA} algorithm originates from the static and dynamic swarming behaviours of dragonflies in nature. {T}wo essential phases of optimization, exploration and exploitation, are designed by modelling the social interaction of dragonflies in navigating, searching for foods, and avoiding enemies when swarming dynamically or statistically. {T}he paper also considers the proposal of binary and multi-objective versions of {DA} called binary {DA} ({BDA}) and multi-objective {DA} ({MODA}), respectively. {T}he proposed algorithms are benchmarked by several mathematical test functions and one real case study qualitatively and quantitatively. {T}he results of {DA} and {BDA} prove that the proposed algorithms are able to improve the initial random population for a given problem, converge towards the global optimum, and provide very competitive results compared to other well-known algorithms in the literature. {T}he results of {MODA} also show that this algorithm tends to find very accurate approximations of {P}areto optimal solutions with high uniform distribution for multi-objective problems. {T}he set of designs obtained for the submarine propeller design problem demonstrate the merits of {MODA} in solving challenging real problems with unknown true {P}areto optimal front as well. {N}ote that the source codes of the {DA}, {BDA}, and {MODA} algorithms are publicly available at                   http://www.alimirjalili.com/{DA}.html                                  .},

  abstract =  { {T}his article describes the {B}uildings library, a free open-source library that is implemented in {M}odelica, an equation-based object-oriented modelling language. {T}he library supports rapid prototyping, as well as design and operation of building energy and control systems. {F}irst, we describe the scope of the library, which covers heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, multi-zone heat transfer and multi-zone airflow and contaminant transport. {N}ext, we describe differentiability requirements and address how we implemented them. {W}e describe the class hierarchy that allows implementing component models by extending partial implementations of base models of heat and mass exchangers, and by instantiating basic models for conservation equations and flow resistances. {W}e also describe associated tools for pre- and post-processing, regression tests, co-simulation and real-time data exchange with building automation systems. {T}he article closes with an example of a chilled water plant, with and without water-side economizer, in which we analysed the system-level efficiency for different control setpoints. },
